What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I get multiple options when I initialize a repository! I need to do it to create commits!
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is imaginary thing that is there to help you understand the logic of adding. The working directory is an actual working space of the repository. The repository is the real space, a group of commits.
